 * 
 * An <code>IEntityGroup</code> that answers if it contains an entity 
 * by delegating to the local group store.  By contrast, an 
 * <code>EntityGroupImpl</code> answers this by examining (and if 
 * necessary initializing) its own member cache.  This behavior is 
 * designed to accommodate groups whose membership is computed by 
 * testing the prospective entity member rather than by testing the 
 * group.  It allows contains() and deepContains() to work correctly 
 * for groups from services like PAGS and JitLDAP.  Groups in these
 * services do not keep references to their members but only define 
 * the logic for computing if a candidate entity is a member.
